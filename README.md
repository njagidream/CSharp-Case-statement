# CSharp-Case-statement
Using case statement with C#<br/>

<p><b>Hello Coders</b></p>
Programming excites me and the though that so many things today are posssible today because of code is very exciting.<br/>
I wrote my first code at the age 14 years in Pascal. Later in life I have interacted with many languages like C, C++, Java, Javascript, VB 6, ASP, PHP, and C# to name but a few.<br/>
With C# i have not done alot with it but I have interest in learning it and going far with it.<br/>
Am hoping this small C# code will teach someone a new concept.<br/>
Feel free to enhance it further and share it here and with others.<br/>
NB: Did you know you do not neeed to install the Viual Studio environment to write and execute C# programs. Windows has the dot Net frame work that handles that.<br/>
You can compile and run your programs on the CMD command prompt. Google this to learn some more.<br/>
